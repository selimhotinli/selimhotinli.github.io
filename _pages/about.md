I am currently the Horizon Postdoctoral Fellow at Johns Hopkins University. Previously, I was a PhD student at Imperial College London where I was a [president's scholar][https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/presidents-phd-scholarships].

I am interested in understanding the origin, contents, and evolution of the Universe. The focus of my research is developing effective and novel ways to probe the fundamental characteristics of our Universe as well as cosmological astrophysics, while making the upcoming deluge of cosmological data sets more than the sum of their parts. I have a particular interest in leading scientific programs involving joint-analyses of different tracers of large-scale structure (LSS) and CMB.
